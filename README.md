# Compass Scholarship Program API

In this technical challenge, my goal is to develop a RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework in Java 17 and Maven 3.0.9. The API should handle the basic operations of the four HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The application's domain revolves around the Compass Scholarship Program classes, allowing registration of organizers (Coordinators, instructors, and Scrum Masters), students, classes, and squads.
